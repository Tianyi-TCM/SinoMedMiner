\title{Co-occurrence frequency calculation
Provides a fast method to calculate the co-occurrence frequencies of Chinese herbs.}
\usage{
cooc(herb_matrix, top = NULL, min_threshold = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{herb_matrix}{A data frame where the first column is the prescription ID, and the remaining columns represent herbs, with values of 0 or 1. A 0 indicates the herb is not used, while a 1 indicates it is used.}

\item{top}{Selects the top 'top' herbs to calculate co-occurrence frequencies. By default, this is NULL, meaning all herbs are considered. If 'top' is not empty and within the number of columns, the top 'top' columns are selected; if 'top' is empty or exceeds the number of columns, all columns are selected.}

\item{min_threshold}{A threshold for co-occurrence frequency. By default, this is NULL, meaning no filtering is applied. If 'min_threshold' is not empty, only results with co-occurrence frequencies greater than or equal to 'min_threshold' are retained.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing herb pairs and their co-occurrence frequencies, sorted by co-occurrence frequency in descending order by default.
}

\examples{
herb_matrix <- data.frame(
  id = 1:5,
  huangqi = c(1, 1, 1, 0, 1),

  danshen = c(0, 0, 1, 0, 0)

# Calculate the co-occurrence count of all herbs

# Calculate the co-occurrence count of the top 2 herbs
